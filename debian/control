Description: Linux container runtime
 Docker complements kernel namespacing with a high-level API which operates at
 the process level. It runs unix processes with strong guarantees of isolation
 and repeatability across servers.
 .
 Docker is a great building block for automating distributed systems:
 large-scale web deployments, database clusters, continuous deployment systems,
 private PaaS, service-oriented architectures, etc.
 .
 This package contains the daemon and client. Using docker.io on non-amd64 hosts
 is not supported at this time. Please be careful when using it on anything
 besides amd64.
 .
 Also, note that kernel version 3.8 or above is required for proper operation of
 the daemon process, and that any lower versions may have subtle and/or glaring
 issues.

Package: vim-syntax-docker
Architecture: all
Depends: vim, ${misc:Depends}
Recommends: vim-addon-manager
Suggests: docker.io
Description: Docker container engine - Vim highlighting syntax files
 This package provides syntax files for the Vim editor for editing Dockerfiles
 from the Docker container engine.

Package: golang-docker-dev
Architecture: all
Depends: ${misc:Depends}
Built-Using: ${misc:Built-Using}
Description: Externally reusable Go packages included with Docker
 These packages are intentionally developed by upstream in such a way that they
 are reusable to projects outside Docker and only rely on each other or other
 external dependencies to be built.
